Have you ever felt pumped, at peak condition for an iminent gaming session while you push the button on your controller to the beep sound as your Playstation turns on or whatever Xbox does, _"I'm strictly PS, deal with it Microsoft"_ and thought to yourself, wow this is the perfect time to killstreak on Call of Duty, score some bangers on Fifa, serve up the dunks on 2K or finally solve that adventure game puzzle that ended your last session? 

Well if you have, you're not alone. Hi, this is my summary of a paper titled "Exploring How Preference and Perceived Performance Vary in Different Game Genres Across Time of Day" by Dominic Kao, an assistant professor at Purdue University and J.J. De Simone, PhD. You can check out the paper **[here](http://people.csail.mit.edu/dkao/pdf/kao2019fdg3.pdf)**. 

Okay ladies and gentlemen gamers, _"err That sounded cooler in my head"_, anyway ready, yellow, lets go!!!
