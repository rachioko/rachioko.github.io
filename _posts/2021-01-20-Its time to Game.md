This is my summary of a paper titled "Exploring How Preference and Perceived Performance Vary in Different Game Genres Across Time of Day" by Dominic Kao, an assistant professor at Purdue University and J.J. De Simone, PhD. 

You can check out the paper [here](http://people.csail.mit.edu/dkao/pdf/kao2019fdg3.pdf). Okay ladies and gentlemen gamers, _err That came out different than what was in my head_, anyway ready, yellow, lets go !!!

### Topic & Research Question

Have you ever thought to yourself, " Damn, this is the perfect time to hit some Call of Duty, Fifa, 2K "? You feel pumped, you feel at peak condition for the iminent gaming session while you push the button on your controller to the beep sound as your Playstation turns on or whatever Xbox does _I'm strictly PS, deal with it Microsoft_. Well if you have, you're not alone and this paper aims to study that.
