We've been exploring the stars for more than a century now, and still no signs of life beyond our own. Are we alone? Are we the aquarium of the universe? Do we think we are alone just because we live in a bubble of the milky way? Surely, we cannot be alone. 

The god dust that disappear and appear, vibrating and running all the possibilities in this universe couldn't possibly create a one-off. So ask yourself this, what's the probability we are alone in the world?
